-   Mosh's personal recomendation is to separate the styles in your stylesheet in groups.
That means, you may have to separate your media queries as well, even if that means repeating your conditions.
Yes, you're repeating yourself a little, but you're keeping your document organized. It'll be more maintainable that way.

-   Mosh first identifies the components he'll need.
Then he defines styles for them, and the needed media queries.
And finally he saves in another folder a copy of the components examples he used when testing their appareance (HTML).

-   If you need to add a certain image a given number of times, you can do it dynamically by using a new class for that.
Just like it was done with the plan--popular class.

-   For displaying quotes, you can either use q tags (which are inline) or blockquotes (which are block-level).
